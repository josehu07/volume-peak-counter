# MP3 Volume Peak Counter

A tiny tool to display the volume (loudness) curve of an `.mp3` music file and count the number of volume peaks in it. Written in three different languages just for fun (C99, Rust, Go).

Available on Linux or OS X platforms.


## Installation

First, clone this git repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:josehu07/volume-peak-counter.git
$ cd volume-peak-counter/
```

Then, prepare the prerequisites:

1. `loudness-scanner` is a git submodule by `jiixyj` ([repo](https://github.com/jiixyj/loudness-scanner)) and should be pulled automatically. Follow its installation guide to build a `loudness` binary at `loudness-scaner/build/loudness`. Please make sure one of its input plugins is working.
2. `gnuplot_i` is a gnuplot interface by Devillard ([page](http://ndevilla.free.fr/gnuplot/gnuplot_i/)). This projects contains a slightly modified version of `gnuplot_i` which adds an `options` argument to `gnuplot_plot_xy`. Type `make` under `gnuplot_i/` folder and make sure that `gnuplot_i/gnuplot_i.o` is correctly produced.

Finally, build the counter by:

```bash
$ make counter-[c|rs|go]   # Choose whatever language version you prefer.
```


## Usage

Run from command line:

```bash
$ ./counter MP3_FILENAME
```
